        # In a real scenario, we would clone into temp_dir directly.
        # For this stub, we'll simulate by moving existing content.
        # This part needs careful implementation in hg_clone_or_update or here.
        # For now, assume hg_clone_or_update put content in ctx.path(".")
        # We need to move it to temp_dir, then symlink.

        # Simulate moving contents to temp_dir (excluding temp_dir itself)
        # This is tricky with repository_rule's execution context.
        # A more robust way is for hg_clone_or_update to clone into a subdir of temp_dir.
        # For now, let's assume the clone happened at ctx.path(".")
        # And we need to make ctx.path(".") point to a subdirectory.
        # This usually involves creating a new directory, symlinking, and deleting old.

        # The actual strip_prefix logic:
        # 1. All content is currently in ctx.path(".")
        # 2. Create a new directory, e.g., ctx.path("stripped_repo")
        # 3. Symlink ctx.path(ctx.attr.strip_prefix) to ctx.path("stripped_repo")
        # This is not straightforward with repository_rule actions directly manipulating the output dir.
        # The common pattern is:
        #   - hg clone to `main_repo_dir_tmp`
        #   - hg_repo_path = main_repo_dir_tmp / ctx.attr.strip_prefix
        #   - Create symlinks from `ctx.path(".")` to `hg_repo_path` contents.
        # This is complex to fully implement here without the actual hg worker.
        # For now, we'll acknowledge it and adjust hg_repo_info_provider.directory if needed.
        # The actual file operations for strip_prefix are usually handled by the worker or utility.
        # Let's assume for now the clone operation itself handles placing files correctly
        # if strip_prefix is given, or that a utility function would adjust the layout.
        # The important part for *this* file is that `patch` and `workspace_and_buildfile`
        # operate on the correct directory.

        # If strip_prefix is used, the effective root changes.
        # The `patch` and `workspace_and_buildfile` should operate on the stripped view.
        # The `ctx.path(".")` is the repository root. If strip_prefix="foo", then
        # the content of interest is in "foo/".
        # The `patch` function from `utils.bzl` might need to be aware of this,
        # or we ensure paths passed to it are relative to the stripped root.
        # For now, we assume `patch` and `workspace_and_buildfile` work on ctx.path(".")
        # and the clone process + strip_prefix makes that path the *correct* one.
        # This means hg_clone_or_update should have placed the stripped content at ctx.path(".").

Clones a remote Mercurial (hg) repository, makes its contents available as a Bazel
repository, and optionally applies patches or custom BUILD/WORKSPACE files.

This rule allows Bazel to depend on external source code managed in Mercurial.
It fetches the repository from a given remote URI, checks out a specific revision,
tag, or branch, and prepares the code for Bazel builds.

**Reproducibility**

For hermeticity and reproducibility, if a `tag` or `branch` is specified,
`hg_repository` will resolve it to a specific changeset ID during the initial fetch.
This resolved changeset ID is then stored. Subsequent fetches (e.g., on a clean
build or when the repository cache is cleared) will use this exact changeset ID,
ensuring that the build uses the same source code version over time. If the
`revision` attribute (a specific changeset ID) is provided, it is used directly,
guaranteeing reproducibility from the outset.

**Mercurial Installation**

This rule requires Mercurial (`hg`) to be installed on the system where Bazel
runs. The `hg` executable must be findable in the system's PATH, or its location
can be specified using the `_hg_tool` attribute (typically configured globally via
a toolchain or by overriding the default Label).

**Example Usage**

To clone the "hello" repository from mercurial-scm.org by tag:

```starlark
load("@rules_hg//hg:defs.bzl", "hg_repository") # Assuming rules_hg is the repo name

hg_repository(
    name = "mercurial_hello",
    remote = "https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hello",
    tag = "0.1",
    build_file_content = \"\"\"
filegroup(
    name = "hello_sources",
    srcs = glob(["*.c", "*.h", "README"]),
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
    \"\"\",
)
```

To clone by a specific revision (changeset ID):

```starlark
hg_repository(
    name = "mercurial_hello_rev",
    remote = "https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hello",
    revision = "03eff24f1f01", # Corresponds to tag 0.1
)
```
